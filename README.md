### Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness in showcasing machine learning techniques.

#### Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The features included in the dataset are:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

#### Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions. Visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships between features and target classes.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies in the data. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Selection:** Experiment with various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), etc.
4. **Model Training:** Train the selected model(s) on the training set.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model(s) using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, analyze the confusion matrix to assess the model's performance on each class.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the model parameters using techniques like grid search or random search to improve performance.
7. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict the species of Iris flowers in the testing set.
